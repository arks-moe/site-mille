          Do you just want to play ngs in peace without rancid doomer vibes?

      <h2 class="">interested?</h2>
      <p>
        if you are interested you can either contact me ingame (PID Mille
        Marteaux) or shout at me on twitter (<a class="link-secondary" href="https://twitter.com/mille_pso2" target="blank">@mille_pso2</a>) which is where i assume you got this page from
      </p>
      <p>
        i am currently, and for the forseeable future, going to be the only
        person with any leadership/invite/kick permissions in this alliance so
        there won't be any room for those bullshit-ass power struggles that
        happen in public alliances sometimes. i also have every right to deny
        entry or kick you for basically any reason (such as disliking your
        vibes) but if i kick you you are free to ask why i did so and i will
        tell you. but be careful
      </p>
      <h3>
        the server invite link if you don't want to wait on me on twitter or
        ngs though is
        <a class="link-secondary" href="https://discord.gg/5rd9rBCEPZ">here</a>...
      </h3>
      <p>
        but there is a purgatory waiting room channel because that's just how
        i run things so do wait warmly
