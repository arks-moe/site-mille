            Did your old alliance just up and leave for FF14 and start game
            hopping?

          <li>
            Do you just want to play ngs in peace without rancid doomer vibes?

          <li>Want to play with someone who likes rig defense?</li>
          <li>
            Do you hate alliances that talk about being <em>"friendly"</em> and
            then its just a ton of people that rag on each other?

        <h2 class="">interested?</h2>
        <p>
          if you are interested you can either contact me ingame (PID Mille
          Marteaux) or shout at me on twitter (<a
            class="link-secondary"
            href="https://twitter.com/mille_pso2"
            target="blank"
            >@mille_pso2</a
          >) which is where i assume you got this page from
        </p>
        <p>
          i am currently, and for the forseeable future, going to be the only
          person with any leadership/invite/kick permissions in this alliance so
          there won't be any room for those bullshit-ass power struggles that
          happen in public alliances sometimes. i also have every right to deny
          entry or kick you for basically any reason (such as disliking your
          vibes) but if i kick you you are free to ask why i did so and i will
          tell you. but be careful
        </p>
        <h3>
          the server invite link if you don't want to wait on me on twitter or
          ngs though is
          <a class="link-secondary" href="https://discord.gg/5rd9rBCEPZ">here</a
          >...
        </h3>
        <p>
          but there is a purgatory waiting room channel because that's just how
          i run things so do wait warmly
